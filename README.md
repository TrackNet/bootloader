# The Bootloader

TrackNet is excited to contribute to the LoRaWANâ„¢ ecosystem by open-sourcing
the firmware updates over-the-air (FUOTA) portion of its end-device LoRaWAN stack.

One important component of this stack is an update-capable bootloader. This loader
supports the unpacking and installing of new firmware on an end-device.

Over the next few days, we will start migrating our internal codebase to this
public repository, where we will then continue to evolve and maintain this component.
This file will be updated as this process continues.
